# asciify

Tiny background:

*  Originally dedicated to a farewell of a colleague

Python scripts are at MVP-level (not elegant & tidy enough).

First, run the `bespoke_ascii_art_gen.py` script to generate the ASCII Art version of an image file and save it as a plain text file (here: .txt).
When inputting the original image path please use the *absolute path*! Always check the output; you may need to tweak the code a bit to adjust the aspect ratio of the plain text version.

Then, if needed, run the `convert_txt_to_image.py` script that can take the plain text output of the above script and generate an image (here: .png) version of it. (Input path: .txt name is sufficient as by defo should be within the same folder).


-- Constructive critiques are *always* welcomed!
